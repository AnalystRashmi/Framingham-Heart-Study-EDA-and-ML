## Using Risk Scores, Stratification for Population Health Management

Population health management requires providers to maintain a delicate balance between taking a long view of generalized patient trends and focusing personal attention on the individual and the distinctive circumstances that will influence her journey towards better health.

Successful population health initiatives have a few commonalities, including a firm grasp on the basics of data analytics, information governance, and how to formulate and leverage the risk scoring and risk stratification techniques that help providers organize the complex needs of their patients.

### Patient Risk Score :
At its fundamental level, a risk score is a standardized metric for the likelihood that an individual will experience a particular outcome.

Organizations can develop risk scores by examining large cohorts of patients with similar characteristics, extracting key clinical and lifestyle indicators from those cases, and using algorithms to chart how those factors influence ultimate outcomes. 

They can then compare other patients exhibiting similar clinical patterns to the validated historical data, which may help predict what will happen in the future.

### Description of the Framingham Heart Study data :

The data for problem come from the Framingham Heart Study, centered in Framingham, Massachusetts. Originating in 1948, the Framingham Heart Study is an ongoing prospective study of risk factors for cardiovascular disease. The Framingham Heart Study is now conducted in collaboration with Boston University. Its objective is to identify common factors or characteristics that contribute to CVD(Cardiovascular disease) by following its development over a long period of time in a large group of participants who had not yet developed overt symptoms of CVD or suffered a heart attack or stroke.

Using accessible metrics such as age, diabetes status, smoking history, cholesterol levels, and body mass index (BMI), study is aimed to predict whether or not an individual is likely to suffer from Cardiovascular disease.
